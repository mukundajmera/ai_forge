# Research Doc Scope Handbook

Covers the `research doc/` directory.

## Mission
- Curate research references, prompt studies, implementation notes, and background material informing AI Forge features.

## Guidelines
- Treat contents as documentation; avoid executable code or large datasets.
- Preserve filenames and structure (note the space in directory name).
- Attribute external research sources; provide links or citations.
- Cross-reference relevant modules and update `docs/research_summary.md` when research impacts implementation.

## Special Considerations
- Do not store confidential or proprietary research without approval.
- Maintain Markdown readability and lint compliance.
- No automation depends directly on this directory; edits should not break tooling.
